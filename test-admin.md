# Testing Admin Functionality

## 🎉 Build Success!

Your Solana blog frontend is now successfully compiled and running!

## 🔗 Access the Application

The development server is running at: **http://localhost:8080**

## 🧪 Testing Admin Access

### Steps to test the admin functionality:

1. **Open the app**: Navigate to http://localhost:8080
2. **Go to Admin page**: Click the "ADMIN" link in the navigation
3. **Connect Phantom wallet**: Click "Connect Phantom Wallet"
4. **Verify admin access**: 

Your wallet address `FzdG9aXQN9fZpDyZvbqMu2zG1PzmdyLzX6nQnDRQRZL7` is now configured as the admin address.

### Expected Behavior:

✅ **With your wallet connected:**
- Admin panel should appear
- You should see options to create/edit posts
- Full blog management functionality

❌ **With other wallets:**
- Shows read-only blog view
- No admin controls visible

### Console Output:

When you connect your wallet, check the browser console (F12) - you should see:
```
Connected wallet: FzdG9aXQN9fZpDyZvbqMu2zG1PzmdyLzX6nQnDRQRZL7
```

This confirms the wallet connection and admin authentication is working.
